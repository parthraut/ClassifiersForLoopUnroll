- Loop unrolling pass (pass to set unroll factor)
- Inserting Timing Code pass (insert timing code for each loop)

- Deciding on what features to use for model
    - write a pass that extracts features from each loop, stores in a json object shown below:

- Preprocessing script and model in python 
    - take in the json obj and train the model


output of dataset:

json obj:
[
    file_name : {
                    [
                        loop_line_num: #
                        feature_1 : #
                        feature_2 : #
                        .
                        .
                        .
                        feature_n : #
                        optimal_unroll_factor: #
                    ]
